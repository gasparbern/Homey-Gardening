<h1>The Succulents</h1>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div style="padding:20px;">

  <p style="font-size: 20px">Succulents are now seen in everything from boutonnieres to hanging planters. They are a trend that is taking over not just gardens, but wedding and home decor as well. Succulents are a type of plant that thrives in dry climates. Most succulents come from areas in Africa or Central America where it is hot and there is little humidity. Because they store water in their leaves,they can withstand long hours in the sun and little watering.

Succulents are known for their low maintenance and long lifespans, which makes them great for people who work all day, are on the go or just aren’t great at taking care of plants. These plants are great for adding structure and vibrance to gardens and homes. There are many types of succulents that can be used as corner plants in a home office or pops of color in a lush garden.

However, even though these drought-resistant plants are simple to maintain, they still have preferences when it comes to location. To help you better understand the different types of succulents and where they grow best, we have composed a list of the 20 most popular types. We’ve categorized them by indoor and outdoor varieties, and created visual guides to help you differentiate between the two types.

      <img src="img\succulents\burrostail.jpg" alt="Burros Tail (sedum morganianum)" width="600" height="400">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">Also known as the donkey tail plant, this succulent is one of the easiest plants to propagate and care for, which makes it a popular houseplant. The burro’s tail was given its name because of its ability to grow up to four inches long with a shape that resembles a tail. This species happens to be a cactus and although all cacti are succulents, not all succulents are cacti. This succulent grows best indoors, placed in a well-drained container, where its long stems can drape down off of the edges of the pot.

      <img src="img\succulents\crown.jpg" alt="Crown of Thorns (euphorbia milii)" width="600" height="400">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">The crown of thorns is a great houseplant because it adjusts well to dry indoor environments and room temperatures. For the best care and results, place this succulent near a window where it can get about three to four hours of sunlight a day. The crown of thorns is very lenient when it comes to missed waterings, but make sure to only water the plant when its soil is completely dry. In Thailand there is a legend that the number of flowers that bloom on a crown of thorns predicts the future of the plant-keeper. So, make sure to take good care of this one!

In late autumn and early winter this succulent produces buds with four petals that can be an array of colors from dark reds to golds and whites.

In the summer, the roseum develops clusters of light-pink star flowers that can add a pop of color to your home decor. It can also add texture to a floral arrangement. This succulent prefers full sun to partial shade, so we recommend placing it on a windowsill that gets a decent amount of light.
